Peit Mondrian Generator == Mondror 

A way to generate Mondrian abstract artwork by changing colors randomly on a given canvas. 
Written in HTML/CSS/Powershell because I did not want to use javascript.

Simple little work done when I was bored.

To use 
Run the powershell script 
Open in the html file 
Enjoy your masterpiece to sell as an NFT! ðŸ’°
